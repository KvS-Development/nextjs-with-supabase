Hide supabase browserClient and serverClient, only expose auth parts, to prevent tempting to use it, since we'll be using the repository pattern instead.
Create example repository for user profile (seems like it should be generic enough that you pretty much always want that anyway)
Add sentry
Add logtail
Add /api/log endpoint for browser side logging, and even then, only upon request by user to provide support.
Add Jest
Add Cypress
Add Chromatic
Strip away resources that aren't relevant, so we have the cleanest template we can think of.
